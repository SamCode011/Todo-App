```sh
npm create vite@latest
 ```sh
 If your're working with JS in the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ "Vite") environment, after loading ,you'll be prompted to continue by
 pressing 'y'.Since everything is now in the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ "Vite") environment,you need to install the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm "Vite")

 ```sh
npm i npm
 ```sh
